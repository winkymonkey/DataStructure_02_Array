	 * As the size of both the arrays are 'n'. Hence merged array size will be '2n' that means always even.

	 * 
	 * Use merge procedure of merge sort
	 *  - while merging, keep the count of processed elements
	 *  - as soon as the count reaches 'n', that means we are at middle
	 *  - take the average of the elements at 'n' and 'n+1' in the merged array

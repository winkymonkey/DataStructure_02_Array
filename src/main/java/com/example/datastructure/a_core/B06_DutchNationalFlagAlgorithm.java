 * Sort N objects colored red, white or blue in such a way that 
 * 	 objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white & blue.
 * The problem is closely related to the partition operation of quick sort.
 * The attribute need not be a 'color',
 * 	 but can be 'greater than the median'/'leading digit is zero'/whatever property you care to choose.

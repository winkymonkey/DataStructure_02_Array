 * Find the minimum distance between two numbers

 * Given an unsorted array A[] and two numbers X and Y.
 * Find the minimum distance between X and Y in A[].
 * The array might also contain duplicates.
 * You may assume that both X and Y are different and present in A[].
 * *****************************************************************************
 * Input:  A[] = {1, 2}		 	X=1, Y=2
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Input:  A[] = {3, 4, 5}		X=3, Y=5
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Input:  A[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}		X=3, Y=6
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Input:  A[] = {2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3}					X=3, Y=2

	 * So the basic approach is to check only consecutive pairs of X and Y.
	 * 
	 * For every element X or Y, check the index of the previous occurrence of X or Y 
	 * 	and if the previous occurring element is not similar to current element update the minimum distance.
	 * 
	 * But a question arises what if an X is preceded by another X and that is preceded by a Y, 
	 * 	then how to get the minimum distance between pairs.
	 * 
	 * By analyzing closely it can be seen that every X followed by a Y or vice versa can only be the closest pair (minimum distance) so ignore all other pairs.

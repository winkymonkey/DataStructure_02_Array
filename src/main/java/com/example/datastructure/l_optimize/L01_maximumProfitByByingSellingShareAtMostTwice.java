 * Maximum profit by buying and selling a share at most twice
 * *****************************************************************************
 * In a daily share trading, a buyer buys shares in the morning and sells it on the same day.
 * If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day,
 * whereas the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (Sell->buy->sell->buy)
 * Given stock prices throughout the day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.
 * 
 * *****************************************************************************
 * Input:   price[] = {10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80}
 * Output:  87										//[buy at 10, sell at 22], [buy at 5, sell at 80]
 * 
 * 
 * Input:   price[] = {2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80}
 * Output:  100										//[buy at price 2, sell at 30], [buy at 8, sell at 80]
 * 
 * 
 * Input:   price[] = {100, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80}
